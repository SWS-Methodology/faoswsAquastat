This document describes the main institutional actors involved in the migration as well as the AQUASTAT - SWS resources (code lists, datasets, data tables) that have been created to support the SWS plugins (R modules) to meet technical unit requirements. Furthermore, the SWS plugins are presented in the form of chapters providing a detailed description of their workflows involving input -&gt; processing -&gt; output as well as results showing whether the modules have lived up to expectations.

["preface.html", "Preface How to use this book Why to use the SWS Migration Team", " Preface How to use this book This book contains the entire documentation of the migration of the AQUASTAT statistical processes to the Statistical Working System (SWS). The chapters are organized by modules. Chapter Description Ch 1 Provides the AQUASTAT framework and entire overview. Ch 2 Provides the whole documentation of the management of AQUASTAT questionnaires. Ch 3 Provides the whole documentation of the module faoswsAquastatExternal. Ch 4 Provides the whole documentation of the module faoswsAquastatUpdate. Appendix Describe all code lists, reference tables (datatables) and data sets. Why to use the SWS The Statistical Working System (SWS) is a corporate system that supports data collection, processing and validation, metadata management, and quality assessment of FAO’s main statistical domains in line with the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. It has a dual nature – both technological and statistical – and for this reason, is developed by two different teams (the IT Division [CSI] and the Statistics Division [ESS]). The SWS provides an end-to-end solution for inputting and storing raw data, performing automated statistical processes (e.g. imputation, validation, etc.), and producing data that are ready for dissemination. Moreover, the reasons why you should use the SWS are: The SWS improves data quality by centralizing and standardizing the maintenance of data, classification systems, methodologies, and standards. The SWS is cost-efficient in terms of statistical development and functionalities: Technical units can adopt methods and even pieces of codes developed for other units: documentation and scripts are open; Users have direct access to some common datasets, thus removing duplication of efforts; New functionalities reflect the requirements of all users and are available to all users, with economies of scale on IT development. Users have full control of the quality of the data they are producing: Increased use of advanced and semi-automated statistical methods reduce the need for manual interventions and ensure that results are reproducible; Establishment and use of a ‘basic’ set of quality and performance indicators for processes and outputs based on the FAO Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF); Assessment and publication of quality indicators on a regular basis. The SWS ensures corporate data consistency through the adoption of statistical standards. In particular, the SWS Facilitates the adoption of corporate standard classifications, metadata and code lists through seamless integration with the corporate Reference Data Management system; Reduces the fragmentation and duplication of sources (e.g. population data), thus reducing inconsistencies across technical units; Provides flexible tools for a wide range of data collection processes including web data scraping and questionnaire management, thus reducing the duplication of data collection efforts. The SWS preserves institutional knowledge by recording the history of data revisions, automating methodology and calculations, and providing end users with unambiguous instructions to follow. Go to the Statistical Working System website (restricted access). Migration Team Any migration into the SWS requires the interaction between at least three teams: The technical unit interested in automating either some or all its analytical processes in the SWS. The technical unit can be treated as client demanding services from the counterparts responsible for the implementation of its data and statistical assets in the SWS. Therefore, a successful AQUASTAT - SWS migration depends on the coordination between the technical division and other parts. In the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework the technical unit is called AQUASTAT and is represented by: Virginie Gillet Land and Water Officer (NSL) Jippe Hoogeveen Technical Officer (NSL) The ESS - Methodological Innovation Team (ESS - SWS) responsible for the implementation and documentation of the required statistical processes. From the ESS - SWS team the focal points for AQUASTAT - SWS migration are: Bruno Caetano Vidigal Statistician (ESS) Francy Lisboa Agronomist/Statistician (ESS) Carola Fabi Senior Statistician (ESS) The CSI - SWS the primary backend and frontend maintainer of the SWS and responsible for the implementation and documentation of non-statistical processes (IT infrastructure). The CSI - SWS team have as interlocutors: Enrico Anello Full Stack Developer (CSI) Matteo Terrinoni Lead Front End Developer (CSI) Rohi Fadlun Full Stack Java Developer (CSI) John Rowell Information Technology Officer (CSI) "],
["AquastatFramework.html", "Chapter 1 AQUASTAT Framework 1.1 Data Collection 1.2 Questionnaire 1.3 The current AQUASTAT information management 1.4 AQUASTAT in SWS: proposed dataflow 1.5 AQUASTAT Elements", " Chapter 1 AQUASTAT Framework The book focuses on the migration of the AQUASTAT statistical processes to SWS. However, for those interested, AQUASTAT has a dedicated FAO website where the new methodology for data collection and data management can be accessed. The next sections summarize the AQUASTAT data collection and information management methodology. 1.1 Data Collection Data collection relies on a network of AQUASTAT national correspondents in charge of the provision of official national data; As of August 2020, 150 countries have nominated AQUASTAT national correspondents as requested by FAO Land and Water Division between April-May 2018; Alternate correspondents from different agencies are also used to improve the data collection; The FAO Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS) has endorsed the annual Water and Agriculture questionnaire as well as the long version of the 2020 questionnaire to be sent every 5 years; AQUASTAT sends out the questionnaire in the first semester of each year. 1.2 Questionnaire The Water and Agriculture questionnaire has the following characteristics: Three introductory sections: Cover page, Instructions, Definitions; One data reporting section, including national data on water withdrawal, municipal wastewater, irrigation and drainage; Four Supplementary Information sections: SDG 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 calculation sheets, Metadata, Feedback. To download the annual Water and Agriculture questionnaire, please click on this link. 1.3 The current AQUASTAT information management Figure 1.1: Aquastat Information Management 1.4 AQUASTAT in SWS: proposed dataflow AQUASTAT dataflow will predominantly be triggered by the filling and compilation of the Water and Agriculture questionnaire by the AQUASTAT network of National Correspondents. In the future, a tailored questionnaire harvester could be created in collaboration with CSI to automatically extract data from filled surveys and output it as an SWS compliant dataset. Once in the SWS, the technical unit will benefit from the tools and other features that have been developed to make the AQUASTAT dataflow as seamless as possible. On this basis, the flowchart below gives the AQUASTAT dataflow that has been fostered by the ESS - SWS team. Figure 1.2: Developed AQUATAST - SWS dataflow 1.5 AQUASTAT Elements The next chapters will treat the modules as well as their datasets and datatables in more details. However, after describing the current SWS resources involved in the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework, it is important to have a look at how the technical units references its data and the list of the data collected, processed, and disseminated. 1.5.1 International Classification Systems AQUASTAT datasets use the following international classification systems to reference its elements: The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities: ISIC4; The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water: SEEA-Water for water resources and withdrawals; The World Census of Agriculture 2020: WCA (Volume 1), for irrigation definitions. 1.5.2 Current AQUASTAT Variables Variables are AQUASTAT elements that are non-calculated.

This identification is made with the help of the SWS datatable aqua_external_sources below: Table 3.1: AQUASTAT external sources - First rows element_code element_name source source_item_code source_element_code data_link 4100 Total area of the country (excl. coastal water) FAOSTAT 6600 5110 http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Inputs_LandUse_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip 4101 Arable land area FAOSTAT 6621 5110 http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Inputs_LandUse_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip 4102 Permanent crops area FAOSTAT 6650 5110 http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Inputs_LandUse_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip 4103 Cultivated area (arable land + permanent crops) FAOSTAT 6620 5110 http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Inputs_LandUse_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip 4104 Total population FAOSTAT 3010 511 http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Population_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip 4105 Rural population FAOSTAT 3010 551 http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Population_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip After identification, the module downloads the data to temporary files and read it in to start the processing. 3.0.1 Reshapes the data sources Data from different sources are likely to occur in different formats. Therefore, after the download of the data, the module needs to apply a different reshaping strategy to each data source. Regardless the initial shape of the external AQUASTAT data sources, the module is going to convert each single source into an SWS long format dataset with geographicAreaM49, aquastatElement, timePointYears, flagOvservationStatus and flagMethod. The flagOvservationStatus and flagMethod are “X” and “c” for all data extracted by the faoswsAquasatExternal module. 3.0.2 Maps out AQUASTAT to external sources With the data already reshaped, it is effortless for the module to keep relevant AQUASTAT elements since the aqua_external_source data table provides the means for correctly mapping out the original external data code to AQUASTAT codes. 3.0.3 Maps out FAOSTAT areas to UNSDM49 The SWS datatable m49_fs_iso_mapping has the correspondence among different international codes (FAOSTAT, UNSDM49, ISO2, ISO3) for geographic areas and is used to convert area codes in the external sources to UNSDM49 codes which is the standard in the SWS. 3.0.4 Saves the output back into SWS Finally, the module merges the sources into a single dataset. This output is an SWS-compliant long-format dataset name aquastat_external that is saved by the user in the SWS and will be ready to serve as an input of the faoswsAquastatUpdate module. 3.1 Running the module Log in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select AQUASTAT domain and aquastat_external dataset; Select whatever geographicM49Area, aquastatElement, and timePointYears; Figure 3.2: Steps 1 to 4 The faoswsAquastatExternal searches and downloads data from external sources. Therefore, what the user is selecting in the query is irrelevant for the module’s output. Run the query and get an empty session; Figure 3.3: Empty SWS session of the aquastat_external dataset Click on Run plugin on the top-right; Select the faoswsAquastatExternal module and click on Run plugin; Figure 3.4: Select the AquastatExternal plugin and run it 8. Wait for the results to appear in the session; Figure 3.5: Select the AquastatExternal plugin output in the session Click on Save to dataset. In case new external data are available, please click on Save to dataset for the new data to be integrated to the aquastat_external dataset and later to the aquastat_update dataset; The aquastat_external dataset has already been saved in the SWS database to prop up the faoswsAquastatUpdate module development. If the user knows that the External sources have not been updated, he/she does not neeed to save the dataset gain. "],

This can be done only for the formulas that are linear combination. For instance, for a given country and year, an indicator and all its components are known. The idea then is to calculate the share of each component based on that indicator and fill in the gaps where the indicator is also available but the components are not. The example below illustrates the vertical imputation method. Figure 4.2: Bulgaria - Vertical Imputation [4311]=[4308]+[4309]+[4310] The vertical imputation is applied on the selected elements (components). See the components by formula. Mind that none of them are LTA.

For the elements classified as LTA (Long-Term Average), the module will just carry-forward their values as they are elements that are not supposed to change over time. However, if the element is not LTA, the linear interpolation method takes place if there are at least two non-missing values in the time series. If not, the only possible way to impute it is through the carry-forward. 4.1.4 Recalculate indicators (Second calculation) The time-series completeness brought by imputations is used by the recalculation step to try to calculate the remaining indicators that were still missing after the first calcualtion. This is the last step before getting the outcome. 4.2 Running the module Log in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select AQUASTAT domain and aquastat_update dataset; Select whatever country, measured element, and timePointYears; Run the query by clicking on the Run button; Figure 4.3: Steps 1 to 5 to run the module in the SWS. Click on Run plugin on the top-right (see figure below); Select the faoswsAquastatUpdate module, choose the set of countries (All countries or Session countries) and click on Run plugin on the bottom-right. Please note that the running of the plugin for all countries takes over 24 hours because of the reading/saving metadata process; Figure 4.4: Select the faoswsAquastatUpdate and run it in the SWS. 8. Wait for the results to appear in the session; Figure 4.5: Wait for the end of the processing (~ 15 minutes). 9. Check the populated session and click on Save to dataset after validation. Figure 4.6: Wait for the end of the processing (~ 15 minutes). 4.3 Flag Assignment The flag assignment constitutes a paramount step in the migration of any process to the SWS, helping to understand how the data was collected/estimated and also in the validation process. The plugin faoswsAquastatUpdate provides an important information on the metadata regarding the origin of each data point. In this way it is possible to analyse the relevance of flags by origin. See the figure below with the set of flags for each origin. Figure 4.7: Relevance of flags by origin Mind that the size of each rectangle is determined by the number of data points. Therefore, the flags I,t and I,e are the ones which have more relevance in the module while I,i is the one with less relevance. 4.4 AQUASTAT Network The calculation rules are the key part of the plugin faoswsAquastatUpdate as it provides the formulas to calculate the indicators, including the SDG’s indicators. As an indicator can be also a component of another indicator, a deeper analysis of how indicators and components are linked to each other is needed. Below you can see how the AQUASTAT elements are connected to each other. It is important to note that there is a high concentration of elements connected, what could evidence a mutual dependency. The elements are split into three categories: Indicator, Component and Indicator&amp;Component. For instance, 4313 has the largest circle, which means that it’s the variable that has more connections. In this case, the connections means that many indicators depend on 4313. Other networks are completely isolated, as per 4455, 4454 and 4101 (on the left of the figure). Figure 4.8: AQUASTAT Network Despite the fact that the network above can be convoluted to understand given a high concentration of elements interconnected, the graph above is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) as per the result of the test in R. This means that it contains no cycles. "],

Data tables are typically used as auxiliary data to help R modules to achieve their goals. The statistical domains in SWS, through code/reference lists, define the dimensions of the datasets. Therefore, datasets are primarily used to store code list - referenced values as either input and output in the SWS. A.1 Code lists Code lists, also called reference lists in SWS parlance, are the dimensions making up the data sets that are designed by the user to store analytical results from SWS modules. The dimensions are statistical-domain-specific and are defined by the technical unit to reflect its needs regarding data collection, processing, and dissemination while meeting FAO standards. Each data set dimension has a set of codes and their associated descriptions. Thus, code lists serve to the purpose of standardization, visualization, and metadata by associating standardized codes to standardized names in the SWS data set outputs. A typical SWS compliant data set has, therefore, the following dimensions/reference lists: Geographic area. Representing a spatial scale the information is measured at. For example, countries, territories, regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. In SWS, the geographic area dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named geographicAreaM49. Items. Those one wants to take a measurement from. For example, commodities, commodity groups, land use types, species, etc. Typical item dimension names are measuredItemCPC, *measuredItemHS, measuredItem. The AQUASTAT - SWS framework does not include item code/reference list. Elements. Often representing a measurement that can be taken across different items. For example, area, production, share. In SWS, the element dimension/code list used by AQUASTAT is aquastatElement. Time (the time unit the data is displayed for: year, months, etc). In SWS, the time dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named timePointYears. Flag (A standardized label indicating origin and/or nature of a number in the data set, e.g. (Official number)). In SWS, the flag dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named flagObservationStatus. Please check the OCS statistical standards and the flags document to understand the flagObservationStatus rational and obtain the description of flags. Table A.1: Observation Status Flags Annotations Flag Description Annotation &lt;blank&gt; Official figure Observation reported to FAO by official statistical government agencies. B Time series break Break observations are characterized as such whendifferent content exist or a different methodology has beenapplied to this observation as compared with the preceding one (the one given for the previous period). E Estimated value Observation obtained through an estimation methodology (e.g. to produce back-casts) or based on the use of a limited amount of data or ad hoc sampling and through additional calculations (e.g. to produce a value at an early stage of the production stage while not all data are available). It may also be used in case of experimental data (e.g. in the context of a pilot ahead of a full scale production process) or in case of data of (anticipated/assessed) low quality. If needed, additional (uncoded) information can be provided through (free text) “comments” at the observation level or at a higher level. F Forecast value Value deemed to assess the magnitude which a quantity will assume at some future point of time (as distinct from \"“estimated value”\" which attempts to assess the magnitude of an already existent quantity). I Imputed value Observation imputed by FAO to replace or fill gaps in national data series, in line with the recommendations of the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA). O Missing value This code is to be used when no distinction is made between the reasons why data are missing. Data can be missing due to various reasons: data do not exist, are insignificant (or not collected because they are below a certain threshold), are unreliable, are not relevant for the period, or other reason not elsewhere specified. M Missing value (data cannot exist, not applicable) Used to denote empty cells resulting from the impossibility to collect a statistical value (e.g. a particular education level or type of institution may be not applicable to a given country’s education system). Q Missing value; suppressed Used when data are suppressed due to statistical confidentiality considerations. N Not significant (negligible) An observation is below the unit precision level. P Provisional value An observation is characterized as “provisional” when the source agency –while it bases its calculations on its standard production methodology –considers that the data, almost certainly, are expected to be revised. R Revised Revised official figure. S Exceptional event Exceptional events such as earthquake, massive forest fire, draught and flooding that occurred in the corresponding period that may have affected the observation or caused a missing value. T Unofficial figure Observation reported by non-official or semi-official sources. Includes semi-official figure. Includes data from trade organizations (e.g. International Grain Council, International Sugar Organization etc.). X Figure from international organizations Observations, both official and non-official, reported by governmental international organizations (e.g. UN, ILO, WB, UNESCO, Eurostat etc. specification on which international organization is provided in the metadata). - Method (A standardized label indicating method utilized to obtain a number in the data set.

Information in datatables can be of a number of types. For example, conversion factors, arithmetic formulas, mapping between flags, mapping between international classifications, etc. In SWS hierarchy. all datatables reside in a given statistical domain. Variable names (aka column names) in SWS datatables are more flexible in terms of the names they can take than SWS datasets. One can find SWS datatables naming variables as element_code, element_code_sws, element_code_faostat, etc. Likewise, columns describing countries across different datatable may have different classification systems. This flexibility in datatables is beneficial as it allows to accommodate different auxiliary information. In the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework, the data tables are in the Aquastat domain. Below is a list of current available and filled data tables in the Aquastat domain.

Because SWS datasets contain code lists following international standards as dimensions, there is little space for variation of dimension names across SWS datasets for the sake of standardization. In the AQUASTAT - SWS framework, the available data sets are: aquastat_legacy. The aquastat_legacy is an SWS dataset with the legacy data from the ‘Old’ AQUASTAT working system. The CSI - SWS has migrated the aquastat_legacy dataset into the SWS in order to store the whole data coming from the old system. The aquastat_legacy dataset is the bare minimum of AQUASTAT, meaning that none analytical process has been applied to it, including the calculation of AQUASTAT indicators (aka derived variables). aquastat_questionnaire. An SWS dataset fed with new data (though import) to be incorporated in the AQUASTAT database. This dataset feeds, along with the aquastat_external and the aquastat_update datasets, the faoswsAquastatUpdate module. More information is found in the chapter 2. aquastat_external. An SWS dataset output from the faoswsAquastatExternal module which replaces the lack of a proper CSI-developed harvester for external source data used by AQUASTAT. More information is found in the chapter 3. aquastat_update. This dataset is the most complete dataset, storing the AQUASTAT compiled data. For more details, please see chapter 4. aquastat_legacy_2flags. This is a copy of the Aquastat_legacy dataset where the flags of the old AQUASTAT working system have been converted to the SWS flags using the following mapping. aquastat_legacy_ltacorrected. This is a copy of the Aquastat_legacy_2flags dataset where the Long Term Averages (LTA) variables, mostly corresponding to water resources variables, have been uploaded for each year (vs once every 5 year in the old working system) and corrected when needed. Indeed the migration from the old working system to the SWS for these LTA created some differences in the dataset. "]
